> All senior design projects must meet our [Project Criteria](/criteria). Pay particular attention to the need for your project to have both algorithmic and technical components.
> Here are some ideas to get you started...

# RTX Autonomous Vehicle Competition
GW has participated in an autonomous drone competition since 2023-2024. Each year the competition presents a new contest for students to build one or more drones to overcome challenges. This is an **interdisciplinary project** that will span CS, ECE, and MAE. The CS team will primarily be responsible for developing the software to control the drones. GW will then take the drones to a competition to see how we perform compared to other schools. This is a great chance work on a real hardware/software project and build connections with Raytheon/RTX, a major R&D corporation for the US Government.

# Sign Language Communication Aid
The purpose of this project is to create a system that enables more natural/seamless communication for deaf individuals by capturing and translating sign language into text or voice. In addition, create a system for those who do not know sign language to communicate in sign language, making communication more natural and bidirectional. This is an **interdiscipinary project** with students in both ECE and CS.

# Distraction Free Commuting Productivity/Entertainment
Create an application to make my hour long commute more productive or fun. The application should be designed for someone driving a car so it must be entirely audio based and be designed to limit distractions while still giving the driver something entertaining/useful to do.

# Healthcare Data Analytics Platform
Develop an algorithm for analyzing medical data to predict disease outcomes or suggest personalized treatments. Implement a web-based application that securely processes and visualizes patient data, taking into consideration data privacy and security measures.

# Traffic Optimization System:
Design an algorithm to optimize traffic flow in a city based on real-time data from various sources. Develop a software solution that integrates with traffic lights, cameras, and other infrastructure to implement the algorithm and manage traffic patterns.

# Financial Portfolio Management Tool:
Create an algorithm that optimizes investment portfolio allocations based on risk tolerance and market trends. Build a web or mobile application that allows users to manage their portfolios, leveraging the algorithmic insights.

# AI-Powered Rental Platform for College Students
Develop an AI-driven platform that streamlines the process of finding rental properties for college students. The platform allows students to search for rentals based on proximity to their college, budget, and specific preferences. It also assists landlords in finding suitable tenants by matching their properties with students' needs. The project employs machine learning algorithms to recommend optimal listings, incorporating real-time data on rental prices and availability. The platform aims to simplify the housing search process for students and enhance property management for landlords.

# AI-Powered Wearable Health System for College Students
Project Description: Develop an AI-driven health monitoring system that integrates with wearable devices like smartphones and Apple Watches to track college students' sleep, diet, exercise, and other health-related activities. The system analyzes the collected data and provides personalized health recommendations based on the latest scientific research in health and wellness. By connecting the system to evidence-based studies, it offers suggestions that are not only personalized but also grounded in proven health outcomes. The project aims to improve students' well-being and academic performance through scientifically backed health management, offering actionable insights on a weekly or monthly basis.

# ML Based Management of Serverless Functions
*Faculty contact for details: Prof Tim Wood*

Sledge is a serverless computing framework being developed at GW for low latency computation. This project will extend Sledge with an ML model to predict the processing time for each request and use this to guide resource management decisions such as scheduling and load balancing.

## Project ideas from previous years
These ideas may still be available.

# High Performance Remote Procedure Calls
*Faculty contact for details: Prof Tim Wood*

Every time you submit a search request on Google, it is transformed into 100s to 1000s of queries sent to many different servers for processing. These requests are performed using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), which allow one piece of software to easily invoke functionality in another. This project will design and implement a RPC protocol focused on low latency processing of requests, and will be built to work with the OpenNetVM project created by students in Prof. Tim Wood's lab. You will learn about the design of networking protocols, get practice with writing high performance C code, and learn about shared memory communication.
 
# CS Experimenter's Notebook
*Faculty contact for details: Prof Tim Wood*

Computer Science researchers often need to run experiments to test the performance of different algorithms or pieces of software. This project will design a web-based tool to help researchers design experiments, run tests, gather data, and analyze/visualize results. The primary challenge with this project is designing a system which is flexible to support many different types of experiments -- an OS designer might want to run experiments to evaluate the impact of different schedulers, while a ML researcher may need to evaluate the impact of different neural network parameters on multiple data sets. How can you design a tool that can easily run these diverse workloads and gather the data in a consistent way so that it can be easily analyzed and reproduced?

# BikeBuddy: Safe and Customizable Cycling Routes
